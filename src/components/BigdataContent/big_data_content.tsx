          As the amount of data continues to skyrocket, organizations using
          traditional technology platforms are not able to easily process it.
          The key to our success is to determine how big data fits into your
          overall business plan. With an effective method for capturing, storing
          and managing underlying data, big data offers a number of benefits to
          organizations:
        </p>
        <List className={classes.list}>
          <ListItem>Integration of structured and unstructured data</ListItem>
          <ListItem>Makes information more transparent</ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Creates and stores more transactional data in digital form than ever
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Improve decision-making, minimize risks and unlock valuable
            insights. (risk analytics, market analytics, customer analytics,
            supply chain analytics etc.)
