                Retail banking business is growing rapidly to cater to the needs
                of the 21st century customer. From credit card payments to
                gadget banking through mobile phones and smart watches, the
                avenues of transacting with a financial bank are endless. This
                opens up the case for why Retail Banking is a great place for
                fraudsters to swindle money. Companies are beginning to leverage
                advanced analytics, machine learning and Big Data technologies
                to detect and prevent fraud, and segregate fraudulent activities
                from legitimate ones. Besides, identification of patterns,
                gaining holistic view of their customer base and the ability to
                gather predictive analytics are some of the advantages of using
                the cutting edge technologies like Apache Spark and the like.

                Gaining Customer Insight using Spark on IBM z Systems
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the key factors in running a business successfully is
                making sure the companyâ€™s customer base is happy. Gaining
                insights into a customer using different tools and technologies
                can play a pivotal role in providing a business the ability to
                measure the satisfaction levels of its customer base, and
                enables the executives with informed decision making
                capabilities. In this use case, we show how we can use Spark on
                IBM z Systems to generate real time analytics using a variety of
                customer data that a Retail Banking company has at its disposal.
                This includes survey data, social media data, historical and
                real time data generated from transactional systems.
