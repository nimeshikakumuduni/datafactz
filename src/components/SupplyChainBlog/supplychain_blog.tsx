            Globalization, shrinking product life cycles, security and
            governance concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties have lead to
            extreme volatility in product demand. In a 2014 survey of chief
            supply chain officers conducted by SCM World, 65 percent of
            respondents indicated that big data analytics in the supply chain is
            the most disruptive and important trend in supply chain strategy.
            Companies with the best supply chain practices, tools and
            technologies capable of thriving under these volatile conditions
            gain a significant competitive advantage. The insights derived from
            analytics in the supply chain help companies optimize their supply
            chain functions and manage market pressures to maximize financial
            performance.

            Companies have greatly increased the focus on supply chain
            management in recent years. However, this added investment and focus
            has been largely ineffective due to a lack of structured
            technological framework to create customized supply chain strategies
            for different types of products. Functional products such as
            toothpaste and detergent have relatively stable demand and mostly
            compete on cost. For these products, supply chain cost efficiency is
            critical. Innovative products like smart phones and high-end
            televisions provide better profit margins, but experience
            significant demand uncertainties. Supply chains for these products
            have to compete on responsiveness and flexibility. Our analytic
            solutions help organizations find an effective combination of supply
            chain strategy and business strategy by designing and controlling
            the key drivers of supply chain management.

                While supply chains aa great deal in their size and structure,
                many core drivers for effective supply chain management are
                consistent across organizations. Analytics platforms and
                solutions balance these drivers to best align the overall supply
                chain performance with the objectives of the business.
                Facilities: Given the significant capital investment involved,
                analytics are used to in facility design to ensure they are
                capable of meeting both short and long term capacity, approach
                and technology needs. Analytics also help optimize the levels
                and types of flexibility necessary within individual facilities
                to thrive under market demand uncertainties. Analytics support
                facility operations, leading to effective production planning,
                staffing, scheduling and control strategies. Inventory:
                Inventory plays a critical role in supply chains to balance
                supply and demand. While most companies are still employing
                outdated and shortsighted local inventory management policies
                that can greatly contribute to supply chain misinformation and
                the inefficiencies, leading companies have adopted multi-level
                inventory optimization techniques to strategically coordinate
                inventories throughout supply coordinate inventories throughout
                supply and distribution networks. Warehouse cross-docking,

                strategies, combined with product assortment planning analytics,
                allow companies to manage market pressures for improved
                financial performance. Logistics: Fluctuating demand patterns
                and an expanding base of suppliers and logistics partners have
                driven companies to continuously rethink their forward and
                reverse logistics network strategies. Companies can achieve
                strong ROI improvements through analytics driven planning
                activities, such as route optimization, load planning, fleet
                sizing, and freight cost reconciliation. Instead of isolated
                changes to network metrics, analytics solutions help monitor and
                adjust network designs periodically for increased cost
                efficiency. Sourcing: As businesses expand into new, volatile
                markets with diversified product portfolios, managing a
                multitude of suppliers around the world becomes challenging.
                Signing on each new supplier has considerable costs and
                potential risks. While competition in the supply chain drives
                lower prices, the results be counterproductive without proper
                balancing. Sophisticated analytics programs generate real-time
                supplier performance management data that supply chain managers
                can use to improve their sourcing strategy. This data empowers
                sourcing professionals with analysis and insights from initial
                screening to ongoing risk management. The result is a holistic,
                data-driven and efficient supplier selection process.

                Pricing: Pricing, and more broadly, revenue management, has
                become a critical driver for many companies in a growing number
                of industries that suffer from long supply chain lead-times,
                demand volatility and perishable products. Dynamic pricing
                strategies enabled by analytic platforms that can mine
                historical sales transactions and combine them with unstructured
                data such as weather patterns and chatter on social networks
                have proved to highly effective in increasing revenues while
                also improving customer satisfaction. Information: Information
                from strategic deployment of information technology is the only
                driver capable of improving both responsiveness and cost
                efficiency in the supply chain. This is the key differentiator
                between supply chains of the past and those of the present. This
                information is essential to promoting visibility, collaboration,
                and control throughout the supply chain. This improves and
                strengthens the supply chain by making data readily available to
                all stakeholders. Increasing supply chain efficiency begins with
                enhancing basic metrics and reporting, as they provide essential
                data for performance improvement initiatives and a full view of
                the extended supply chain. Advanced analytics that rely on these
                data streams help organizations make decisions to increase
                supply chain responsiveness and cost efficiency and minimize
                customer impact.
